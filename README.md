# Walterbot
Recreational Discord bot built using Discord's Javascript API
#
Walterbot will scan server messages and try to write them again using chemical symbols. For example:

[User]: Hi Lucio! \n
[WALTERBOT]: Hydrogen, Iodine, Lutetium, Carbon, Iodine, Oxygen
//(H)(I)(Lu)(C)(I)(O)

Walterbot's name is inspired by Walter White from Breaking Bad and it can also retrieve quotes from the show!
